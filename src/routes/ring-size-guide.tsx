Wrap a thin strip of paper snugly around the base of your finger, mark where it overlaps, and measure the length in millimetres — that is your finger circumference. Match it in the chart below. Measure at the end of the day when fingers are largest, and size up if your knuckle is prominent."

        { q: "What if I'm between two sizes?", a: "Choose the larger size — a slightly loose ring is more comfortable and can be resized down easily." },

        { q: "Can Nazara resize my ring?", a: "Most designs can be resized by 1–2 sizes free of charge within the first year. Eternity bands with full stone coverage cannot be resized." },
        { q: "How do I measure for a surprise gift?", a: "Borrow a ring they wear on the intended finger and measure its inner diameter, or trace its inner circle on paper and bring it to our store." },
