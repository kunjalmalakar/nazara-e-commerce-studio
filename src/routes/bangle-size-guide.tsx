        { q: "What does a 2.4 size mean?", a: "It is the inner diameter in inches — 2 and 4/16 inches (2.25 in / about 57 mm). The second digit counts sixteenths of an inch." },
        { q: "How do I find my bangle size without a bangle?", a: "Fold your thumb to your little finger and measure around the widest part of your hand, then match that circumference in the chart above." },
        { q: "Is FS (free size) suitable for everyone?", a: "FS bangles with an openable clasp or flexible design fit most wrists between sizes 2.4 and 2.8, but rigid FS pieces suit average wrists best." },
        { q: "What are average Indian bangle sizes?", a: "Most Indian women wear 2.4 to 2.6; 2.6 is the most commonly purchased size." },
        { q: "Do kadas fit differently from bangles?", a: "Yes — kadas are broader and rigid, so many prefer a quarter size larger than their bangle size, or an openable kada for a closer fit." },
        { q: "Should a bangle fit snug or loose?", a: "It should slide over the knuckles with gentle pressure and rest with a little movement on the wrist — snug enough not to slip off, loose enough to rotate freely." },
